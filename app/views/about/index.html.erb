<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We sell plants. And not just any plants—thriving, photogenic, emotionally supportive green roommates. Whether you’re a certified plant parent or a repeat plant murderer, we’ve got foliage that forgives.

Cactus judging you? That’s normal. Fern acting dramatic? That’s showbiz, baby. Come grab a new oxygen factory and give your windowsill the glow-up it deserves. Dirt cheap. Literally.</p>
